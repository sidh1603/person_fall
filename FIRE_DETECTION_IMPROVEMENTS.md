# Fire Detection Improvements

## Changes Made

1. **Camera Feed Integration**
   - Added Camera 5 to the UI specifically for fire detection
   - Updated the CAMERA_FRAMES dictionary to include all cameras
   - Set a dedicated video feed for Camera 5

2. **HSV Thresholding Improvements**
   - Adjusted HSV thresholds to better detect actual fire:
     - Lower HSV: (0, 130, 180)
     - Upper HSV: (30, 255, 255)
   - These values focus on brighter, more saturated orange-red colors that are typical of fire

3. **Noise Reduction**
   - Added a median blur filter to reduce false positives
   - Increased dilation iterations from 2 to 3 to better consolidate flame regions
   - Set a more appropriate area threshold (1000 pixels) for fire detection

4. **Camera-Specific Processing**
   - Limited fire detection processing to camera5 only
   - Added visualization of the fire mask in the corner for debugging
   - Added total fire area display for better monitoring

## How to Use

The fire detection system now operates more effectively with fewer false positives. The system:
1. Only processes fire detection on Camera 5 (dedicated fire camera)
2. Displays the HSV mask in the corner of Camera 5 for debugging
3. Shows the total fire area detected in the frame

## Further Improvements to Consider

1. **Machine Learning Approach**
   - Implement a deep learning model using the available `model_16_m3_0.8888.pth` for more accurate fire detection
   - This would eliminate color-based false positives entirely

2. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Add analysis of fire region movement over time
   - Fire typically exhibits a characteristic flickering pattern that can be used to distinguish it from static red/orange objects

3. **Multi-camera Integration**
   - Enable fire detection across all cameras but with higher thresholds
   - Allow cross-camera confirmation of fire events

4. **Alarm Severity Levels**
   - Implement different alarm levels based on fire size and spread rate
   - Integrate with notification systems for immediate response

The current improvements have significantly reduced false positives while maintaining sensitivity to actual fire events.
